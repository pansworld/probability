# Study in Distributions
A probability distribution of a random variable X is the set of probabilities assigned to each possible value of X.

## Discrete vs. Continuous
### Discrete Random Variables
Variables that take distinct values. Example: Variable that captures the ddice roll takes values 1 through 6.

### Continuous Random Variables
Variables that take any value within a range. Example: Variable that captures the amounr of rainfill.

## Probability Distribution Function vs. Cumulative Distribution Function

### Probability Distribution Fuction
The probability density function $f(x)$ is the probability that $X$ takes on values between two adjacent realizations of the random variable.

### Cumulative Distribution Function
1. Monotonically non-decreasing function (Function that may be flat in some ranges and increasing in others)
2. such that $\lim_{x\to-\infty} f(x) = 0$ and $\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x) = 1$
3. Defined as $F(x) = P(X \le x)$
