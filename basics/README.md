## Taylor Series
Useful for approximating functions in terms of ploynomials. 

Example:
When calculating $cos(\theta)$ we can approximate it the following polynomial. It is easy to derive this value. See [Taylor Series: Essence of Caclulus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6DsjIBzJ4)

$$ cos(\theta) \approx 1 - \theta^2/2! + \theta^4/4! $$  

can be visualized as:





## Sine and Cosine

## Euler's formula

## Fourier Transform
